# Post-mortem
During this project I used jQuery to manipulate the DOM. jQuery helped to condense lines of code for easier readability. Using moment.js for working with time in relation to the user and dynamically created HTML elements was a very informative experience. Especially navigating the documentation and applying the syntax and logic to this application.
